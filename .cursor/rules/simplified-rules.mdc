## 📝 **CURSOR RULES FOR .cursorrules**

```
# RAG System Development Rules

## Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI + Supabase + OpenAI
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Focus on working functionality over perfect code

## Backend Patterns
- Use async/await for all I/O operations
- Implement proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Follow dependency injection pattern for services
- Use logging for debugging and monitoring

## Frontend Patterns
- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Implement React hooks for state management
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow component composition pattern
- Implement loading states and error boundaries

## Database Patterns
- Use Supabase for PostgreSQL + vector storage
- Implement proper indexing for vector search
- Use UUIDs for all primary keys
- Follow ACID principles for data integrity

## Implementation Priority
1. Start with backend foundation (database, document processing, embeddings)
2. Build core RAG pipeline (chunking, vector search, response generation)
3. Create frontend components (upload, chat interface)
4. Integrate frontend with backend
5. Add error handling and polish

## Testing Strategy
- Test each component as you build it
- Use console.log for debugging
- Test API endpoints with curl/Postman
- Test frontend with browser dev tools
```
