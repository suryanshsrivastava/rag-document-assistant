# Krazimo Take Home Assignment

## Overview

Welcome to our technical assessment\! This assignment is designed to evaluate your full-stack AI engineering capabilities through your progress, approach, and problem-solving methodology. We want to see how you think, plan, and execute on complex AI-powered applications.

**Time Allocation:** 2 days  
**Tech Stack Required:** Next.js, FastAPI, Supabase

**Expectation:** We want to see your progress and approach, not necessarily a fully polished product

---

## What We're Really Evaluating

**Your Development Process (40%)**

* How you break down complex problems into manageable pieces  
* Your prioritization of features and implementation order  
* Quality of your planning and architectural decisions  
* How you handle challenges and pivot when needed

**Technical Competency (35%)**

* Code quality and organization in what you do build  
* Understanding of AI concepts and implementation approaches  
* Effective use of the required tech stack  
* Problem-solving skills and technical reasoning

**Communication & Documentation (25%)**

* Ability to explain your thought process and decisions  
* Quality of documentation for what you've built  
* Clear articulation of next steps and remaining work  
* Honest assessment of progress and challenges

---

### **AI-Powered Development**

Use AI tools to help you code\! This shows you're up-to-date with modern development.

**Recommended Tool**: Cursor IDE (or any AI-powered IDE you prefer)

### **Open Source Libraries**

Use any open-source libraries you want. We care more about *why* you chose them than *which* ones you picked.

---

## **Problem Statement**

### **Intelligent Document Workspace**

Create an AI-powered system where users can upload documents and have intelligent conversations about their content.

**Sample user journey:**

* Upload research papers, reports, or articles  
* Ask complex questions that span multiple documents  
* Get insights, summaries, and connections between documents  
* Build knowledge over time through accumulated interactions

---

## What We Want to See in Your Submission

**1\. Clear Problem Definition & Scope**

**Tell us:**

* What specific aspect you decided to focus on  
* What your target user experience looks like  
* How you scoped the work for the time available

**2\. System Architecture & Planning**

Show us:

* High-level system design and component relationships  
* How RAG and AI agent functionality will work together  
* Database schema and data flow planning  
* API structure and integration points

**3\. Implementation Progress**

We want to see whatever you built:

* Core functionality, even if incomplete  
* Quality of code structure and organization  
* Evidence of RAG implementation (document processing, embeddings, retrieval)  
* AI agent capabilities (reasoning, tool use, conversation handling)  
* Frontend interface and user experience

**4\. Technical Decision Documentation**

Explain:

* Why you chose specific approaches or libraries  
* Trade-offs you considered in your design  
* How you used AI development tools in your process  
* Challenges you encountered and how you addressed them

**5\. Next Steps & Roadmap**

Outline:

* What you would build next with more time  
* Known issues or limitations in your current implementation  
* How you would scale or improve the system  
* Features that would enhance the user experience

---

## Technical Requirements

**Core Components to Address:**

1. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
* Document ingestion and processing pipeline  
* Vector embedding and storage strategy  
* Semantic search and retrieval mechanism  
* Response generation with source attribution  
2. **AI Agent Capabilities**  
* Multi-step reasoning or conversation flow  
* Integration with external tools or APIs  
* Context management across interactions  
* Decision-making and response routing  
3. **Full Stack Implementation**  
* Frontend: User interface for your chosen problem domain  
* Backend: API endpoints supporting AI functionality  
* Database: Data persistence for users, documents, and interactions

---

## Submission Format

**1\. GitHub Repository**

Include:

* Complete source code with clear organization  
* Comprehensive README with setup instructions  
* Documentation of your architecture and approach  
* Clear indication of what's implemented vs. planned

---

## Evaluation Approach

**We're Looking For:**  
✅ Clear thinking and problem decomposition  
✅ Quality implementation of what you do build  
✅ Honest communication about progress and challenges  
✅ Good architectural planning and technical decisions

✅ Effective use of AI development tools

**We're NOT Expecting:**  
❌ A fully polished, production-ready application  
❌ Every feature implemented perfectly  
❌ Complex deployment setups or infrastructure

❌ Extensive test coverage (though good code organization matters)

---

### Success Strategies:

* Start simple: Get basic functionality working first  
* Document as you go: Keep notes on decisions and challenges  
* Focus on core value: What's the most important capability to demonstrate?  
* Be realistic: Better to do fewer things well than many things poorly  
* Use AI tools effectively: Leverage Cursor and other AI assistance

---

**Interview Discussion**

Be prepared to discuss:

* Your problem-solving approach: How you broke down the challenge  
* Technical decisions: Why you chose specific implementations  
* AI tool usage: How AI development tools influenced your process  
* Challenges faced: What was harder than expected and how you adapted  
* Next steps: How you would continue development with more time  
* Learning: What you discovered about AI application development  
* What you're proud of in your implementation  
* What didn't go as planned and why  
* How AI tools helped or hindered your progress  
* What you learned during the process

---

Remember: We want to see how you think and work, not judge you on delivering a complete product. Show us your process, be honest about your progress, and demonstrate your technical capabilities within the time constraints. Quality over quantity\! 🚀
